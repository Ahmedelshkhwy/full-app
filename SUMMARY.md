## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Service Layer:
```typescript
AdminService
├── Product Operations (CRUD)
├── Category Operations
├── User Operations  
├── Order Operations
├── Image Processing
├── Validation Helpers
└── Error Handling
```

### Component Architecture:
```typescript
AdminProductsScreen
├── State Management (React hooks)
├── Service Integration (useAdminService)
├── Error Handling (try-catch with AdminServiceError)
├── Form Management (validation, submission)
├── UI Components (ProductCard, Modal, etc.)
└── Utility Functions (formatting, status)
```

### Error Handling Flow:
```typescript
API Call → AdminService → Error Detection → 
AdminServiceError → Component Catch → User Feedback
```
